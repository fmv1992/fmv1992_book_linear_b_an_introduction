# Companion to «[J.T. Hooker's Linear B: An Introduction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/384071.Linear_B?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=3ky1mkBllK&rank=1)»

## Flash cards

The [Mnemosyne](https://mnemosyne-proj.org/) flash cards can be found [here](https://github.com/fmv1992/fmv1992_book_linear_b_an_introduction/blob/main/output/flash_cards/linear_b_glyphs_from_unicode.cards#L1).

At the moment they are only front-to-back.

The flash cards are auto generated from the [unicode points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B_Ideograms) PDF description, and as such a few of them don't have labels. Also, some logograms are missing (but all the syllabary is present). I intend to populate these changes in the future, with the aid of manual working (as opposed to the current fully automated process).
